Notice that CPU time is different from normal time. First of all, it should measure only the effective running time of the process instead of just the time passed between the start and the end of the computation. Moreover, it also considers threads in multicore environments: a task using two threads on two cores will have both those usages measured and added up in the total CPU time which, for this reason, may also end up higher than the “absolute” time elapsed between the beginning and the completion. To capture this measure, the C++ library ctime has been used. It is important also to notice that depending on the system clock and operative system it may provide slightly different behaviors on different platforms.
